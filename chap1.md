## 4. Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?
The world wide web where links are morphisms doesn't form a category because the composition law is not satisfied. If there is a link from a website A to website B and a link from website B to website C there is no guarantee that there is a link from website A to website C.

## 5. Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?
Facebook is not a category with friendships as morphisms since morphisms in this context violate the composition law. If person A is friends with person B and person B is friends with person C there is no guarantee that person C is friends with person A.

## 6. When is a directed graph a category?
A directed graph is a category when there exists an edge from every node to itself (the identity morphism) and that if there exists an edge from node A to node B and an edge from node B to node C there must exist an edge from node A to node C (composition law).
